-- Important to note that this function is mainly for asserting whether we need to
-- time a player's action. Player actions which are not mandatory such as posting a blind
-- to start a game will not be timed actions.
--
-- All possible player actions are either compulsary or optional. For example SitIn as a player is never forced to play a game. However if a player is already active in an
-- ongoing hand then all future actions for this hand will be mandatory and therefore timed so that a given
-- player cannot postpone the game through inactivity for an indefinite amount of time.
--
-- Optional actions as as SitIn (changing player state to In to denote that they are active this hand)
-- would return False in this function.
--
-- PostBlind actions are trickier. Depending on the context they will be compulsary or optional.
-- True is for a situation where the continued progression
-- of the game in a satisfactory timeframe is determined by the expediancy of the current
-- player's action.
